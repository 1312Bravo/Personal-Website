            <p>
                Urh Peček is a financial mathematician who is not very interested in economics and a bio statistician who is not very interested in biology. Yes, I know, interesting isn't it.
                Two of my life's passions are the mentioned interlacement of mathematics, statistics and data analysis, and on the other hand, sports.

                The only logical thing in the world for me is mathematics. I don't like learning by heart, but prefer derivations and equations from which I can fully understand the final conclusion.
                I consider myself a »forever student«, in terms of a person who is always striving to improve and learn new things in his profession.
                I'm a very aesthetic type of a person. In that way I include my artistic streak into data science.
            </p>

            <p>
                I love animals very much, they are my best friends. I try to save every fly, spider or insect.
                I devote most of my free time to sports. Mostly doing, but also watching. I played ice hockey in primary and high school, and then then devoted my sports activities to street workout (street gymnastics) for a couple of years.
                For the last few years my main sport activity has been trail running and road cycling. I love mountains and winding roads that I prefer to be climbed rather than descended.
                P.S. I made a T-shirt merch: #Tokyo2020(Japan).
