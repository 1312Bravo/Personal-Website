        <div class="About_text">
            <p>
                Urh Peček is a <span class="clrd1">data analyist</span> or a <span class="clrd1">data scientist</span>.
                He graduated in <span class="clrd1">financial mathematics</span>,
                where he found himself really interested in mathematics and its real world applications.
                That led him to earn a master's degree in <span class="clrd1">applied statistics</span>, which
                remains one of his passions and professions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The most logical thing in the world for me is <span class="clrd1">mathematics</span>,
                as I prefer derivations and equations from which I can fully understand and explain the final
                conclusion.
                I consider myself a <span class="clrd1">»forever student«</span>, in terms of a person who is always
                striving to improve and learn new things in his profession.
                I'm a very <span class="clrd1">aesthetic</span> type of a person as I like to have everything nice and
                tidy and
                also always include my <span class="clrd1">artistic</span> streak into data analysis.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Most of my free time I devote to <span class="clrd1">trail</span> and <span class="clrd1">mountain
                    running</span> and <span class="clrd1">road cycling</span>.
                In trail running I like longer races and training runs with a lot of elevation gain, among big
                mountains,
                where I can experience great adventure and also that little bit of "suffering" that a person needs to
                feel fully alive.
                In cycling I love winding roads, that I prefer to be climbed rather than descended.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I also love <span class="clrd1">animals</span>, I consider them my best friends. All of them. I try to
                save every fly,
                spider or insect. I also like to capture moments in the mountains, on my bike, or just in nature with my
                <span class="clrd1">photo camera</span>, where the center of the picture is most often my
                girlfriend,
                with whom I love spending time together on adventures in nature.
                From time to time I also take on a different project, one of which is a T-shirt merch: <span
                    class="clrd1">#Tokyo2020</span>(Japan).
